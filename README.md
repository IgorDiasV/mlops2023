Hello, my name is Igor Dias, and I am a Computer Engineering student at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN). This repository aims to showcase the results obtained in the development of three projects related to the first unit of the Machine Learning-Based Systems Project course.

The idea behind the projects was to refactor code, implement tests, and follow best practices. The base codes used were taken from the Dataquest platform. For better organization, the repository is divided into three folders, one for each project.

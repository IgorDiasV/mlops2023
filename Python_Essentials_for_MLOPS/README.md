This folder pertains to the projects of the first unit. The objective of this unit was to perform code refactoring, implement tests, and adhere to best practices. The codes used as a foundation were taken from the Dataquest platform. For better organization, the repository is divided into three folders, one for each project.

To run the projects provided in this repository, you need to have Python 3 installed and install the application requirements. You can do this by using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Below is the link to a video with more details about the projects and the refactorings performed. Also, the link to the certificate obtained during the unit is shown.

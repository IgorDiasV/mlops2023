# Python Essentials for MLOps

## Introdution 
This folder pertains to the projects of the first unit. The objective of this unit was to perform code refactoring, implement tests, and adhere to best practices. The codes used as a foundation were taken from the Dataquest platform. For better organization, the repository is divided into three folders, one for each project.

## Project description

- Project 01 - The first project is about movie recommendations.
- Project 02 - The second project involves a data pipeline using Airflow to download podcast episodes.
- Project 03 - The third project focuses on using unsupervised learning to perform credit card customer segmentation. 
To run the projects provided in this repository, you need to have Python 3 installed. If you want to install the requirements for all projects at once, you can do this using the following command:

## Requirements/Tecnologies

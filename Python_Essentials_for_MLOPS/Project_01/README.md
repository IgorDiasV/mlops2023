# Project 1: Movie Recommendation
The first project is related to movie recommendations, where the recommendation is made based on a movie chosen by the user.

Initially, the Pylint tool assigned a score of 4.23 to the code that was used as a base, and after applying the refactorings, 
a score of 9.23 was achieved. This involved reorganizing very long lines, adding docstrings, and more. 
Additionally, logging and unit tests were added. Further details about the refactoring can be seen in the video.

# Getting Started
To execute the project, it is necessary to clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/IgorDiasV/mlops2023.git
```
After cloning the repository, it is necessary to access the folder of this project using the following terminal command:
``` 
 cd mlops2023/Python_Essentials_for_MLOPS/Project_01
```
Once this is done, it is necessary to install the prerequisites shown in the section below.

After installing the prerequisites, simply use the notebook 'movie_recommendations.' The code was designed to be used in the main 'mlops' folder, so if opened in a different folder, you may need to adjust the DATA_DIR variable to specify the location where the CSV files are located.

## Prerequisites
It is necessary to have Python 3 installed and the modules listed in the requirements file. To install the modules, you can use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The first project is related to movie recommendations, where the recommendation is made based on a movie chosen by the user.

Initially, the Pylint tool assigned a score of 4.23 to the code that was used as a base, and after applying the refactorings, 
a score of 9.23 was achieved. This involved reorganizing very long lines, adding docstrings, and more. 
Additionally, logging and unit tests were added. Further details about the refactoring can be seen in the video.

# Project 1: Movie Recommendation
The first project is related to movie recommendations, where the recommendation is made based on a movie chosen by the user.
Below are the instructions on how to run the project.

# Getting Started
To execute the project, it is necessary to clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/IgorDiasV/mlops2023.git
```
After cloning the repository, it is necessary to access the folder of this project using the following terminal command:
``` 
 cd mlops2023/Python_Essentials_for_MLOPS/Project_01
```
Once this is done, it is necessary to install the prerequisites shown in the section below.

After installing the prerequisites, simply use the notebook 'movie_recommendations.' The code was designed to be used in the main 'mlops' folder, so if opened in a different folder, you may need to adjust the DATA_DIR variable to specify the location where the CSV files are located.

## Prerequisites
It is necessary to have Python 3 installed and the modules listed in the requirements file. To install the modules, you can use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

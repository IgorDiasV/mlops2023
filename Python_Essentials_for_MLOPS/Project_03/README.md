# Project 3: Credit Card Customer Segmentation
The third project is about credit card customer segmentation based on their profiles.
Below are the instructions on how to run the project.

# Getting Started
To execute the project, it is necessary to clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/IgorDiasV/mlops2023.git
```
After cloning the repository, it is necessary to access the folder of this project using the following terminal command:
``` 
 cd mlops2023/Python_Essentials_for_MLOPS/Project_03
```
Once this is done, it is necessary to install the prerequisites shown in the section below.

After installing the prerequisites, the code can be executed using the following command:

```
 python credit_card_customer_segmentation.py
```
The code was designed to be used in the main 'mlops' folder, so if opened in a different folder, you may need to adjust the PATH variable to specify the location where the CSV files are located.
## Prerequisites
You need to have Python 3 installed. Additionally, you should have the modules listed in the requirements installed as well. To install the modules, you can use the following command:
